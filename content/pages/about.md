title: Hello there 👋🏼

I am Lucas, a **software developer** living in Paris, France.

I seek to deepen my knowledge and skills on a daily basis, and I truly believe that one of the best ways to learn is by helping other developers, like myself, address issues.

Interested in _Web technologies_, _Open-source projects_, _Command Line Interfaces_ and in whatever my curiosity leads me to in the future.

You can find all of my posts on my [**website**](https://lucasnp.com/), as well as on [**dev.to**](https://dev.to/lucasnevespereira) and [**Medium**](https://pereiraneveslucas.medium.com/) <br />
I used to have a [**Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JqfPrr4nHKvbwLAdk-MgA) you can check it out and I [**tweet**](https://twitter.com/lucaasnp_) sometimes.

Finally, if you're interested in my code and projects, explore my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira) account.

Feel free to reach out to me for any collaborations, inquiries, or just to say hello!

See you soon, <br />
