I am Lucas, a **software developer** living in Paris, France.

I try to deepen my knowledge and skills on a daily basis, and I truly belive that one of the best ways to learn is by helping other developers like me adressing issues.

Interested in _Web technologies_, _Open-source projects_, _Headless CMS_ and in whatever my curiosity leads me to in the future.

You can find all of my posts in this site or in my [**dev.to**](https://dev.to/lucasnevespereira) and [**medium**](https://pereiraneveslucas.medium.com/) accounts <br />
I used to have a [**Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JqfPrr4nHKvbwLAdk-MgA) you can check it out and I [**tweet**](https://twitter.com/lucaasnp_) sometimes <br/>

Finally, if you have any interest in my my code check my [**github**](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira) account.

See you soon, <br />
