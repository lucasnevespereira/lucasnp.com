      <description>I am Lucas, a software developer living in Paris, France.
I seek to deepen my knowledge and skills on a daily basis, and I truly believe that one of the best ways to learn is by helping other developers, like myself, address issues.
Interested in Web technologies, Open-source projects, Command Line Interfaces and in whatever my curiosity leads me to in the future.
You can find all of my posts on my website, as well as on dev.</description>
