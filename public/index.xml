      <description>Hi everyone! In this post I want to show how to quickly setup a desktop app using this amazing Go library Wails.
Basically, Wails allows to write desktop softwares using web technologies like Angular, React, Vue, Svelte..
Installing Wails Getting started with this library is quite easy, if you have all the prerequesites you just need to run a go get to install it in your local machine, if you need details this is going to add wails to the pkg directory of your GOPATH.</description>

      <description>Hello there üôÇ
First of all you all may be wondering &amp;ldquo;What in the world is gituser??&amp;rdquo;
Gituser is a command line interface made with Golang that helps to switch between different git user accounts.
I have built this cli because I was using my laptop for my personal projects, my school projects and my work related projects. Meaning I had multiple git user accounts in my machine.
Every time I had to type the following command:</description>

The source code to follow along if needed is here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s do this üëçüèª As an example we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a very simple Post API.
Structure the project Let&amp;rsquo;s jump to our terminal and create a new directory for our project and then init a go module.</description>

      <description>Hello dear readers, being a Junior to Mid Developer myself I&amp;rsquo;ve been of course faced to this weird &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo; of testing my code. Maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t fear, maybe we just do not talk much about it.
But either way I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently learning to program in Golang and I want it to do it seriously, in the right way. That&amp;rsquo;s why this time I did not skip the tests subject.</description>

      <description>Hello there, before starting this article I want to give you a bit of context. So, I wrote an article about how to build a custom API with Strapi and fetch it from an Angular app. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it i&amp;rsquo;ll link it right above üôÇ.
Connect custom Strapi API to an Angular App
This article is a part 2 of that article as I am going to deploy the API on Heroku and the Angular app on Netlify.</description>

      <description>I recently decided to rebuild my portfolio with Angular. The problem is that I wanted to easily post and update my projects, I first thought about build an NodeJS/Express API connected with MongoDB but this can be time consuming for me knowing that I have others side projects with a lot of work to do.
I decided to take a look into headless CMS, that&amp;rsquo;s when I find out aboutStrapi.</description>

Hello I&amp;rsquo;m Lucas, I started Web Development last year and I work now at my first web developer job. I started web development with HTML5/CSS3 and then moved on directly to PHP and JavaScript . Well this is cool but I realized at my job that I was really missing a lot of basics and foundations about computer science and programming in general. If you do not have a mathematical / engineering background sometimes this can be challenging at your first job, because you&amp;rsquo;re just missing basics.</description>
