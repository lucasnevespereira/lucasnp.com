      <description>Hello there, before starting this article I want to give you a bit of context. So, I wrote an article about how to build a custom API with Strapi and fetch it from an Angular app. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it i&amp;rsquo;ll link it right above ðŸ™‚.

This article is a part 2 of that article as I am going to deploy the API on Heroku and the Angular app on Netlify.</description>

      <description>I recently decided to rebuild my portfolio with Angular. The problem is that I wanted to easily post and update my projects, I first thought about build an NodeJS/Express API connected with MongoDB but this can be time consuming for me knowing that I have others side projects with a lot of work to do.
I decided to take a look into headless CMS, that&amp;rsquo;s when I find out aboutStrapi.</description>
