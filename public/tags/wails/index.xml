      <description>Hi everyone! In this post I want to show how to quickly setup a desktop app using this amazing Go library Wails.
Basically, Wails allows to write desktop softwares using web technologies like Angular, React, Vue, Svelte..
Installing Wails Getting started with this library is quite easy, if you have all the prerequesites you just need to run a go get to install it in your local machine, if you need details this is going to add wails to the pkg directory of your GOPATH.</description>
